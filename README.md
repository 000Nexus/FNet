# Hello again, there are changes!
------------------------------------------------------

Other than the usual working on the project I have decided i'm going to start coding the project in node.js.
This is a REALLY big change because I only started learning it 3 weeks ago, and I want to try it.

If you are wondering, the source code will be available. I may change my mind later.

If you want to keep up to date, please watch the repo!

I'll be releasing the a executable in less than 2 months.

# Details!

> I'll be using Express, and REST for api usage.
> More plans for other packages soon.

# Suggestions

> If you'd like to suggest a package for technique I could use for making this, please let me know! I'd be more than happy to talk to you!

# Other
> I might not be able to get every API available to me, so please tell me if I missed one!


# End

As for now, this is where I go. I'll be back to tell you guys more soon.
