# FNet
Hello! This is the offical guide on how to mount an FNet server to a api host!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is still in development, so please beware that there is going to be random updates.

	-This is as simple as : connecting the ports to designated port 18823 and ws port 18824.

	-- This currently supports: Rec Room 2016 - 2017 (Because I only know how to code for that rn lol)

   	   Ports : Localhost : 18823 
   	   Websocket (ws) : 18824
